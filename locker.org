right now the connected function does not seem to work. Wait for reply on lines
* DONE resync button
Set pos on all tracks to 1
* DONE track mute 
* DONE BUG: quickly place many trigs
* DONE more than 16 steps sequencing
make focus toogle. reimplement locking for this mode - maybe abstraction helpfull instead of doing it twice..
* TODO track speed multipliers
cool times. Current ones seem whacky
* TODO standard values for volates
  currently, to change one note you need to lock two trigs
* TODO CV range selection
Need 0-10 V
* TODO new sequencer type: envelope
Set ADSR with and log/exp with encoders

They seem buggy. 
* TODO shorter slew times for CV
* TODO finer lock values with encoders
* TODO Double time multiplicators
let middle be the default, go up for higher and down 
* DONE setting length only shows playhead of modified sequence
* TODO BUG: trigs one step too late
  trigger when step ends
* TODO transpose v/8 sequences
let keyboard pop up
