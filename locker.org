* TODO link chromatic track to gate track
in order to save some clicks
* TODO new sequencer type: envelope
- set curve log/exp with encoders
- set the max value of the envelope
* TODO track speed multipliers
  cool times. Current ones seem whacky
* DONE page indicator
* TODO standard values for voltages
  currently, to change one note you need to lock two trigs
* TODO CV range selection
Need 0-10 V
* TODO v/8 glide time
* TODO v/8 lock ui 
* TODO trig conditions
* TODO copy/paste trigs
* TODO hold note key pressed on UI one it is pressed
* TODO patterns
* TODO arc implementation
** Ideas:
- in state 0 use encoders to notch sequences
- show current values of CV with leds
- lock with arc
* TODO note numbers
They seem buggy. 
* TODO shorter slew times for CV
* TODO transpose v/8 sequences
let keyboard pop up
* TODO live input
- in grid state 7.
- e.g. in chromatic mode light up keyboard and let it play
- in cv mode values can be recorded in 16/32 levels
- in gate mode maybe 16 lvls of gate-lengths?
* TODO jf mode over i2c
* bugs
** TODO only lock when pressing new value (currently also sets value when button is released)
** TODO locking only works while current page is the active one. otherwise the value of the step in the other active step is locked
** DONE locking envelope in focus track mode does not work correctly.
** DONE BUG: quickly place many trigs
** DONE BUG: trigs one step too late
   trigger when step ends
** DONE crow.connected() Bug
 right now the connected function does not seem to work. Wait for reply on lines
* DONE finer lock values with encoders
* DONE seq type selector
* DONE resync button
Set pos on all tracks to 1
* DONE track mute 
* DONE more than 16 steps sequencing
make focus toogle. reimplement locking for this mode - maybe abstraction helpfull instead of doing it twice..
* DONE setting length only shows playhead of modified sequence
* DONE play/stop buttons
