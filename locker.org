* TODO track speed multipliers
cool times. Current ones seem whacky
* TODO standard values for volates
  currently, to change one note you need to lock two trigs
* TODO CV range selection
Need 0-10 V
* TODO new sequencer type: envelope
Set ADSR with and log/exp with encoders
* TODO v/8 glide time
* TODO v/8 lock ui 
* TODO trig conditions
* TODO copy/paste trigs
* TODO hold note key pressed on UI one it is pressed
* TODO patterns
* TODO arc implementation
** Ideas:
- in state 0 use encoders to notch sequences
- show current values of CV with leds
- lock with arc
* TODO note numbers
They seem buggy. 
* TODO shorter slew times for CV
* TODO finer lock values with encoders
* TODO transpose v/8 sequences
let keyboard pop up
* TODO live input

* bugs
** DONE BUG: quickly place many trigs
** DONE BUG: trigs one step too late
   trigger when step ends
** DONE crow.connected() Bug
 right now the connected function does not seem to work. Wait for reply on lines

* DONE seq type selector
* DONE resync button
Set pos on all tracks to 1
* DONE track mute 
* DONE more than 16 steps sequencing
make focus toogle. reimplement locking for this mode - maybe abstraction helpfull instead of doing it twice..
* DONE setting length only shows playhead of modified sequence
* DONE play/stop buttons
